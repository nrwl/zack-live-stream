# What we're going to try and do today

- Finish our pagination form

  - Make sure prev/next work as expected <== DONE!
  - Make sure to handle cases where the total number of pages changes to less than the current page <== DONE!!

- Create a 'larger form' that uses the pagination form, but combines it with:

  - a 'total item count' @Input
  - a 'items per page' drop down

- [if time allows] show recursive family tree form stackblitz example
