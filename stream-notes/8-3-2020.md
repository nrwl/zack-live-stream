# What we're going to TRY to do today:

- Set up a way to authenticate on our api
- Allow a user to login via our web-client
- Make note of all the bad things we did today

## Authenticate on our API

- create a User interface in our models <== DONE!
- create a backend/auth lib <== DONE!
- create a function to create an accessToken to store in our DB <== DONE
- create a login endpoint that will verify provided credentials, create an accesstoken, then send the access token to the client <== DONE
- create and export a router for our auth to be consumed by our app <== DONE!

## Allow a user to login via web-client

- create a frontend/auth lib <== DONE
- Create a login form component <== DONE
